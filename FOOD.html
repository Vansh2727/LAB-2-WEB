    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>This recipe is courtesy of Pioneer Square D&E, a neighborhood bistro offering creative yet comforting, from
        scratch fare. Founded by Seattle hospitality industry experts, husband and wife Jonathan Fleming and Libby Aker,
        D&E opened Fall 2018 and quickly became a popular neighborhood staple. With previously scaled down its offerings
        due to COVID restrictions, the restaurant is now fully re-open for dine-in, patio seating as well as takeout.
        The recent addition of Anthony Tran as Head Chef, paves the way for a new menu featuring the classic fried
        chicken selections known and loved by the regulars, as well as new seasonal items. The restaurant is located at
        314 2nd Avenue South in Seattle. Find menus, directions, hours and more at pioneersquarede.com and
